HOW DOES IT WORK?                  *render.nvim-render.nvim-how-does-it-work?*


1. render.nvim calls the `vim.api.nvim__screenshot` API to create a `.cat` file containing ANSI escape sequences representing the current Neovim session. This is an undocumented API and may be at risk of breaking changes.2. Converts the `.cat` file to `.html` via aha <https://github.com/theZiz/aha>.3. Converts the `.html` file to `.png` via playwright <https://playwright.dev/>. Playwright spins up a headless chromium browser of the `.html` page and captures the screenshot.
