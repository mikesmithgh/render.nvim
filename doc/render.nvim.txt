INSTALLATION                            *render.nvim-render.nvim-installation*


PREREQUISITES ~


- Neovim v0.9+ <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases>
- Install aha <https://github.com/theZiz/aha>
- Install playwright <https://playwright.dev/>


USING LAZY.NVIM ~

>lua
    return {
      {
        "mikesmithgh/render.nvim",
        config = function()
          require("render").setup()

USING NEOVIM’S BUILT-IN PACKAGE SUPPORT PACK ~

>bash
    mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/mikesmithgh/start/"
    cd $HOME/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/mikesmithgh/start
    git clone git@github.com:mikesmithgh/render.nvim.git

HOW DOES IT WORK?                  *render.nvim-render.nvim-how-does-it-work?*


1. render.nvim calls the `vim.api.nvim__screenshot` API to create a `.cat` file containing ANSI escape sequences representing the current Neovim session. This is an undocumented API and may be at risk of breaking changes.2. Converts the `.cat` file to `.html` via aha <https://github.com/theZiz/aha>.3. Converts the `.html` file to `.png` via playwright <https://playwright.dev/>. Playwright spins up a headless chromium browser of the `.html` page and captures the screenshot.
