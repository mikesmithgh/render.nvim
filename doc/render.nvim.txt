INSTALLATION                            *render.nvim-render.nvim-installation*


PREREQUISITES ~


- Neovim nightly <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/tree/nightly> build
- Install aha <https://github.com/theZiz/aha>
- Install playwright <https://playwright.dev/>


USING LAZY.NVIM ~

>lua
    return {
      {
        "mikesmithgh/render.nvim",
        config = function()
          require("render").setup()
        end,
      },
    }
<


HOW DOES IT WORK? ~


1. render.nvim calls the `vim.api.nvim__screenshot` API to create a `.cat` file containing ANSI escape sequences representing the current Neovim session. This is an undocumented API and may be at risk of breaking changes.2. Converts the `.cat` file to `.html` via aha <https://github.com/theZiz/aha>.3. Converts the `.html` file to `.png` via playwright <https://playwright.dev/>. Playwright spins up a headless chromium browser of the `.html` page and captures the screenshot.
