## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Install [aha](https://github.com/theZiz/aha)
- Install [playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

### Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
return {
  {
    "mikesmithgh/render.nvim",
    config = function()
      require("render").setup()
    end,
  },
}
```

### How does it work?
1. render.nvim calls the `vim.api.nvim__screenshot` API to create a `.cat` file containing ANSI escape sequences representing the current Neovim session. This is an undocumented API and may be at risk of breaking changes.
2. Converts the `.cat` file to `.html` via [aha](https://github.com/theZiz/aha).
3. Converts the `.html` file to `.png` via [playwright](https://playwright.dev/). Playwright spins up a headless chromium browser of the `.html` page and captures the screenshot.
